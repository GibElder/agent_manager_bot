# Multi-Agent Automation Platform

This project is a server-hosted AI automation platform that combines OpenAI and LLaMA language models to execute complex workflows and system tasks. The platform processes natural language commands, manages integrations with Google APIs, interacts with Linux file systems, and runs continuous background security monitoring.

## Features

- Natural language understanding and task parsing
- Multi-step conversational workflows
- Google Calendar and Drive API integration
- File system operations and script execution
- Background security monitoring using AI models
- Modular design for extending additional agent capabilities

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenAI GPT models
- LLaMA language models
- Google API Client Libraries
- Linux shell scripting

## Purpose

This platform was built to experiment with combining language models and traditional automation workflows to create intelligent assistants capable of managing infrastructure, scheduling, and security tasks.

## Status

Ongoing development and experimentation. Some features and integrations are proof-of-concept.
